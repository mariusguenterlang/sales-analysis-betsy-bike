## Executive Summary
### Overview of Findings
With an overall gradual increase in sales, bike accessories have a distinct changepoint in August / September 2008. Other categories, such as bicycles increase over the period but do not show signs of a changepoint. Key performance indicators have all shown year-over-year increases: Revenue by X%, Order Volume by Y%, and Average Order Volume by Z%. This decline can be attributed to an analysis in different types of volume.
