Other categories, such as bicycles increase over the period but do not show signs of a changepoint. Key performance indicators have all shown year-over-year increases: Revenue by X%, Order Volume by Y%, and Average Order Volume by Z%. This decline can be attributed to an analysis in different types of volume.

## Insights Deep Dive


## Recommendations
Based on the uncovered insights, the following recommendations have been provided:
- With X% of revenue coming from just three products, diversifying the product portfolio is crucial. Expanding the accessory category with new product lines, particularly Apple Charging Cables, would provide upsell opportunities.
- Despite the success of bikes in the Americas, bike sales in Europe have been slow. A differentiation of portfolios between Europe and America could increase stock efficiency.
- Re-evaluate the clothing line. Despite an increase in sales, the share of revenue has remained small.
